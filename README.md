This is the source code to our T3 series of programmable controllers including all T3 controllers and the Tstat10 programmable thermostat. 
THe CPU is the Arm STMF103ZE which has reached end of life for most products around Temco. 
Most products have been switched to the ESP32 cpu which provides an 8X increase in rom and 16X increase in ram. 

Here is the new ESP32 repo:
